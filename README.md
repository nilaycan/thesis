# Thesis
Under Python codes, only the thesis related files exist. The detailed knowledge was given under these files apart with "PYTHON_EXPLANATION". These explanation files try to enlighten the idea behind the code.Since the python script depends highly on external libraries, it is possible that this would not be executable in your workstations. If you have these libraries installed or statically linked, it would work fine i guess. In case it would not run, I attached an output format of the python code and a short explanation about it. 
Additionally , this html file is only compatible with "Firefox Mozilla" and "Safari browser".

Under R codes, some algorithms and works attached. They are related to my lecture projects.
